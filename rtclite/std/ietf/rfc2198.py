# @implements RFC2198 (Redundant RTP payload)

'''
Implements RTP payload for redundant audio data as per RFC 2198.

Create the redundant payload using list of tuples, each item (pt, timestamp, payload), where
the first item is the primary with largest timestamp and subsequent ones are redundants.

>>> packet = createRedundant(packets=[(126, 0x0002, '\x01\x01\x01\x01'), (127, 0x0001, '\x02\x02')])
>>> print(packet.encode('hex'))
ff0001027e020201010101

To parse the redundant payload, also supply the primary timestamp from the RTP header, so that
all the redundant packets' timestamps can be adjusted accordingly.

>>> parseRedundant(packet, 0x1002) == [(126, 0x1002, '\x01\x01\x01\x01'), (127, 0x1001, '\x02\x02')]
True
